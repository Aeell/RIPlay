  This file is intended to help automated coding agents (Copilot / other AI) be productive
  when working in this repository. The workspace currently contains no discoverable
  project files—these instructions therefore focus on discovery steps, sensible defaults,
  and how to ask the user for missing information.

# Copilot / AI agent instructions — repo discovery first

Keep this short, factual, and tied to artifacts that actually exist in the repository.

Summary
- There are no application source files or README in the repository root (as of the last scan).
- If you are an agent operating on this workspace, follow the discovery checklist below, ask the user for missing context, and only make non-invasive changes after explicit confirmation.

Discovery checklist (high priority)
1. Look for a top-level `README.md` or files: `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `build.gradle`, `pom.xml`, `Dockerfile`, `src/`, `app/`, or `main.*`.
2. Search for CI/CD configs: `.github/workflows`, `azure-pipelines.yml`, `.circleci/config.yml`.
3. Search for test folders: `tests/`, `spec/`, `__tests__/`.
4. If none of the above exists, prompt the human owner with these questions:
   - What language / runtime should I expect (Node/Python/.NET/Java/etc.)?
   - Which files are the entrypoints and how do you build/run tests locally on Windows PowerShell (pwsh)?
   - Are there any private registries, credentials, or environment files I should not attempt to access?

If you find a README or language-specific manifest
- Extract the "how to build" and "how to run tests" sections and prefer running those commands.
- If the README provides a quickstart (example: `pwsh -File scripts\start.ps1` or `npm install && npm test`), follow it.

What to change without asking
- Minor edits to documentation files (README, scripts) to clarify commands or fix broken links.
- Create missing `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (this file) when none exists.

What to never do without explicit user confirmation
- Add or change secrets / credentials or attempt to contact external services.
- Re-architect large sections of the codebase.
- Publish packages, push to remote repos, or modify CI workflow runs.

Conventions & patterns to look for (examples)
- Node: presence of `package.json`, `scripts` entries (`build`, `test`, `start`), `src/` and `lib/` folders.
- Python: `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `venv/` or `env/` ignored, `src/` layout or flat modules.
- .NET: `*.sln`, `*.csproj`, `Directory.Build.props`.

Windows / PowerShell specifics
- The developer environment here uses Windows with PowerShell as default shell. When suggesting or running commands, prefer PowerShell-compatible forms. Example commands agents may propose to the user:
  - Install deps (Node): `npm install`
  - Run tests (Node): `npm test`
  - Run Python tests (pytest): `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt; pytest`
  - Build .NET: `dotnet build`

Integration points and where to look
- Look for `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile` to learn external services.
- Look for `terraform/`, `k8s/`, or `.github/workflows` to understand CI and infra.

Examples for inline guidance
- If you see `package.json` with a `test` script, run it and report failures with the failing files and stack traces.
- If you see `pyproject.toml` with `tool.poetry`, prefer `poetry install` and `poetry run pytest` (but ask the user if Poetry is available on CI).

Merge guidance (if a previous copilot-instructions file exists)
- Preserve existing bullets that reference real files. Replace or remove entries that point to non-existent files.
- Keep the same tone and short actionable bullets. Do not add long policy essays.

When stuck — exact prompt to present to the human
"I scanned the repository and couldn't find build/test metadata (README, package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.).
Please tell me: (1) the project language/runtime, (2) the exact commands you use to build and run tests locally on Windows PowerShell, and (3) any files I should avoid touching (secrets, generated assets)."

If you are the repository owner and want a more specific instruction file, please add a `README.md` or one of the language manifests and re-run the scan; I will re-generate a more targeted `copilot-instructions.md` using the discovered files.
